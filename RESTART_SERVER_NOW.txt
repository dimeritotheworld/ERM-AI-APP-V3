  URGENT: RESTART THE SERVER
========================================

The PDF export endpoint exists in the code but the running
server is an OLD VERSION without it.

SOLUTION:
---------
1. Close the current Node.js server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
2. Double-click START_SERVER.bat OR run from project root:
   node server/server.js

   (DO NOT cd into server folder - run from root so node_modules is accessible!)

ERROR YOU SAW:
--------------
POST http://localhost:3000/api/reports/export-pdf 404 (Not Found)

WHY IT HAPPENED:
----------------
- The server was started BEFORE we added the PDF export endpoint
- Node.js doesn't reload code automatically
- You need to restart the server to load the new code

WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER RESTART:
-----------------------------
✅ Server will show: "ERM Server running on port 3000"
✅ PDF exports will work from all three locations:
   1. Reports list hamburger → "Export as PDF"
   2. Editor preview → "Export PDF"
   3. Editor toolbar hamburger → "Export PDF"

VERIFICATION:
-------------
After restart, you should see in server logs:
- [PDF Export] Generating PDF for: Report_Title
- [PDF Service] Launching browser...
- [PDF Service] PDF generated successfully
